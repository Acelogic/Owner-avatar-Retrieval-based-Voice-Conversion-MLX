# RVC to MLX Conversion Project

## Overview

This project aims to convert the Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) model from PyTorch to Apple's MLX framework. RVC is a state-of-the-art voice conversion system, and by porting it to MLX, we can leverage the performance benefits of Apple Silicon hardware.

## Project Goals

1. Fully convert the RVC inference pipeline to MLX
2. Maintain or improve the voice conversion quality
3. Optimize performance for Apple Silicon devices
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for voice conversion using the MLX-based RVC

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently in the early stages of development. We are working on:

- [ ] Converting the core RVC model architecture to MLX
- [ ] Adapting the data processing pipeline
- [ ] Implementing MLX-compatible inference logic
- [ ] Testing and benchmarking the converted model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MLX framework
- (Add other dependencies as needed)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rvc-mlx-conversion.git
   cd rvc-mlx-conversion
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

(Add usage instructions once the conversion is at a usable stage)
