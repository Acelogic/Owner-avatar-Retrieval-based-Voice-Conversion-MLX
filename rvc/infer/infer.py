# MLX Conversion Outline for RVC Inference

# 1. Import and setup
import mlx.core as mx
import mlx.nn as nn

# Replace torch imports with MLX equivalents
# import torch -> import mlx.core as mx

# 2. Model definitions
# Redefine SynthesizerTrnMs256NSFsid, SynthesizerTrnMs256NSFsid_nono, 
# SynthesizerTrnMs768NSFsid, SynthesizerTrnMs768NSFsid_nono using MLX

class SynthesizerTrnMs256NSFsid(nn.Module):
    # Redefine the model architecture using MLX layers
    pass

# ... (other model definitions)

# 3. Data loading and processing
# Replace torch.load with MLX equivalent
# cpt = mx.load(person)

# 4. Model instantiation and weight loading
# Adjust model instantiation for MLX
net_g = SynthesizerTrnMs256NSFsid(*cpt["config"])
# Use MLX's way of loading state dict
net_g.load_weights(cpt["weight"])

# 5. Inference pipeline
def voice_conversion(sid, input_audio_path, ...):
    # Convert numpy arrays to MLX arrays where necessary
    # audio = mx.array(audio)
    
    # Adjust the VC.pipeline method to use MLX operations
    
    # Convert MLX array outputs back to numpy for audio writing
    # audio_opt = audio_opt.numpy()

# 6. Utility functions
# Update utility functions to use MLX where appropriate

# 7. Main inference loop
def infer_pipeline(...):
    # Adjust the main pipeline to work with MLX models and operations

# Note: You'll need to carefully go through each PyTorch operation
# and replace it with the MLX equivalent. Some functionality may
# not have direct replacements in MLX and might require workarounds.
